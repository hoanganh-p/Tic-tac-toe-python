## How to Play

- Run `python tic_tac_toe.py` to start the game.
- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all spaces on the board are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
