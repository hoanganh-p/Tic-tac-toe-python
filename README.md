# Tic-tac-toe Python

![Tic-tac-toe](imgs/tic-tac-toe.jpg)

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game in Python.

## How to Play

- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all spaces on the board are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
